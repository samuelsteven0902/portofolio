Hello! I'm Samuel and currently I'm a student at Sebelas Maret University Associate Degree in software engineer who is interested in web development.

I have technology interest in html, css (I use Bootstrap & Tailwind for css framework), JavaScript (I find it very helpful with javascript library which helps my project to be more interactive and since I'm interested in frontend I'm learning about ReactJS and hope to be an expert on this framework), PHP ( I used this for my BackEnd project and once I used Laravel & CodeIgniter for the framework) 

Enthusiastic Junior Web Developer looking to contribute to team success, attention to detail and pretty good organizational skills, I use github for my team work on several projects. Clear understanding of jobdesc. Motivated to learn, grow, and excel in the industry.
